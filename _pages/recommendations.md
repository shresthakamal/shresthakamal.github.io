<sup>_---Worked together Q.I. Roberts Jr. - Sr. High School---_</sup>

<p  style="text-align:justify;">

Kamal and I worked together in delivering the “Introduction to Artificial Intelligence” course at Q.I. Roberts Jr. - Sr. High School based in Florahome, Florida. As a programming instructor for the course, Kamal went above and beyond to make sure the students had a solid foundation to build their careers in the technology field. Throughout the semester, I was impressed by his ability to adapt to challenges, problem solving, and communication skills. The students in the course definitely benefited from Kamal’s experiences and guidance.</p>

Kamal and I worked together for over year in the Academics team. During this time, I have found Kamal to be diligent, sincere, hardworking, and honest. His enthusiasm for work and his excellent communication skills made him an asset for the company and team. Be it in writing code or preparing reading materials, he always met his deadline and his work met the best standards. I was lucky enough to be working with him as his partner in the FuseStudio project. We worked together to create a tool that generates interactive videos directly from the slides. It was while working on this project I discovered his positive attitude towards criticism and feedback. During the development, his code had few issues which I reported to him. He thanked me for pointing out the issues and fixed them the same day. Working with Kamal is both fun and productive. I wish him all the best in all his future endeavours.</p>

I got the opportunity to work with Kamal right from the start of his traineeship as his supervisor and before that for fuse.ai Education Initiative as an Instructor.
As a supervisor and someone working on the same project with him, I have seen him work diligently and demonstrate exceptional abilities to learn and accomplish tasks assigned to him. His programming skills are upto marks and his theoritical background and knowledge is what I cherish the most. He takes his tasks very seriously and goes extra mile to deliver more than the bare minimum. Fusemachines is proud to have him as a trainee from Kathmandu University.</p>

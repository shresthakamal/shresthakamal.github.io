His enthusiasm for work and his excellent communication skills made him an asset for the company and team. Be it in writing code or preparing reading materials, he always met his deadline and his work met the best standards. I was lucky enough to be working with him as his partner in the FuseStudio project. We worked together to create a tool that generates interactive videos directly from the slides. It was while working on this project I discovered his positive attitude towards criticism and feedback. During the development, his code had few issues which I reported to him. He thanked me for pointing out the issues and fixed them the same day. Working with Kamal is both fun and productive. I wish him all the best in all his future endeavours.</p>

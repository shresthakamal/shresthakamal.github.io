I am presently enrolled in a two-year Master of Technology (MTech) program offered by the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.iith.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH)](https://iith.ac.in/). I am working under the supervision of [Dr. Maunendra Sankar Desarkar](https://people.iith.ac.in/maunendra/index.html) as part of my research endeavors. 

Prior to joining IITH, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Kathmandu University](https://ku.edu.np/) in Dhulikhel, Nepal.


In my academic pursuits, I am currently engaged in two primary research projects. 
The first of these projects involves the development of <b>a heuristic-based recommendation engine</b> that is designed to serve as a job recommendation platform, [Swarability](http://swarajability.org/), catering specifically to differently abled individuals. The primary aim of this platform is to provide a range of odd jobs that are tailored to the individual's physical abilities, with the end goal of enhancing their employment opportunities and overall quality of life.

My second research project is focused on <b>conditional language generation for open-domain dialogue systems</b>, with the ultimate goal of enhancing machine-human communication by imbuing these systems with human-like communication abilities. For the same, My approach involves integrating external knowledge sources to instill common sense knowledge and reasoning capabilities in the dialogue systems.

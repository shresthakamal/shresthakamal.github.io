<p style="text-align:justify;">
I am presently enrolled in a two-year Master of Technology (MTech) program offered by the Department of <a href="https://cse.iith.ac.in/" target="_blank">Computer Science and Engineering Department</a> at the <a href="https://iith.ac.in/" target="_blank"> Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH)</a>. I am working under the supervision of <a href="https://people.iith.ac.in/maunendra/index.html">Dr. Maunendra Sankar Desarkar</a> as part of my research endeavors. 
</p>

Prior to joining IITH, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://ku.edu.np/" target="_blank">Kathmandu University</a> in Dhulikhel, Nepal.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
In my academic pursuits, I am currently engaged in two primary research projects. 
The first of these projects involves the development of <b>a heuristic-based recommendation engine</b> that is designed to serve as a job recommendation platform, <a href="http://swarajability.org/">Swarability</a>, catering specifically to differently abled individuals. The primary aim of this platform is to provide a range of odd jobs that are tailored to the individual's physical abilities, with the end goal of enhancing their employment opportunities and overall quality of life.
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
My second research project is focused on <b>conditional language generation for open-domain dialogue systems</b>, with the ultimate goal of enhancing machine-human communication by imbuing these systems with human-like communication abilities. For the same, My approach involves integrating external knowledge sources to instill common sense knowledge and reasoning capabilities in the dialogue systems.

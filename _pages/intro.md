Hello there! 
<br>
My name is Kamal Shrestha.
<br>
Currently, I am about to complete my postgraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the prestigious college, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IITH), India, on a full scholarship. Prior to IITH, I received my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel, Nepal.
I am a professional Machine Learning and Curriculum Engineer working at the intersection of ML, Deep Learning, Natural Langauge Processing and Computer Vision. I have been working in these domains for more than three and a half years. I have a solid foundation in programming with Python, Pytorch, Machine Learning Libraries (Scientific Python, Matplotlib, REST APIs, Scipy, and more), Hugging face Transformers, documentation with Latex (Overleaf), and professional writing with Medium, Beehiv, GetResponse etc.
As a machine learning engineer, I have worked on multiple clients based (in the US and Germany) and in-house projects that involved all stages of applied ML, DL, and NLP in real-world data (from mining, cleaning, extracting, and EDA to model building, deployment, and maintenance).
I have been learning and implementing ML, which includes traditional machine learning models, deep learning, NLP models, CV models and more, all my professional and academic career, published a couple of papers as well. I have received multiple scholarships to learn the same from industry-experienced instructors giving me hands-on implementations as well. I canâ€™t remember how many datasets I have explored, analyzed, and summarised. I have generated multiple EDA reports using pandas and matplotlib to make sense of the data we are working with. Following the EDA, I have also worked on feature selection, normalization, and modeling to train a predictive model.
As a lead curriculum engineer, I have worked to design, create, review, and refine course materials (reading materials, presentation slides, audio transcripts, auto-graded assignments, hands-on implementations, quizzes) for professional courses. Similarly, I taught the courses on similar subjects to students of multiple countries. I am also a certified AWS Machine Learning Engineer with multiple other relevant certifications in the same domain. 
<br>
So, with all my experience, I believe I will be well suited to create insightful content for readers and fit for the project.
